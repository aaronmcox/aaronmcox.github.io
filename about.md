  <h2>Hello!</h2>
</div>

I'm Aaron and I write software. I do it for fun or for Hinge Health. 

I live in Owensboro, KY. I attended Indiana State University in Terre Haute, Indiana. I studied computer science and received M.S. and B.S. degrees for my efforts. I gravitated to multidisciplinary work, participating in bioinformatics and physics projects.
